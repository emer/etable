/*
Package agg provides aggregation functions operating on IndexView indexed views
of etable.Table data, along with standard AggFunc functions that can be used
at any level of aggregation from etensor on up.

The main functions use names to specify columns, and *Index and *Try versions
are available that operate on column indexes and return errors, respectively.

See tsragg package for functions that operate directly on a etensor.Tensor
without the indexview indirection.
